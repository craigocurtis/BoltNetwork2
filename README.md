# BoltNetwork2
Stuck on AngularJS Lesson from CodeCademy

Stuck for a while on AngularJS BoltNetwork 2 on Codecademy.

Different results on local servers:

localhost:3000 = no Angular content shows
localhost:8000 = 7 Sherlock program listings appear rather than Sherlock and Arrested Development.
// the 7 must correspond to the 7 $scope.program properties defined in MainController.js

Answers welcome!
